# USNM Bird Barcodes

This repository contains data and code used for the publication "DNA Barcoding, Collection Management, and the Bird Collection in the Smithsonianâ€™s National Museum of Natural History" by Schindel et al.

## Table of Contents of Notebooks:
1. Creating Table 1 -- Sequence record and species counts
2. Alignment and distance commands
3. [Creating species-level distance summaries](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MikeTrizna/USNMBirdDNABarcoding2017/blob/master/Creating%20species-level%20distance%20summaries.ipynb)
4. Creating Table 2 -- Species-level summary before and after dataset
5. Creating Figure 1 -- Geographic distribution map of sequence records
6. Creating Figure 2 -- Bivariate plot of maximum divergence between members of a species versus minimum divergence between species for the most similar members of each species
7. Creating Supplementary Figure 1: Full Maximum Likelihood tree of USNM Bird dataset

## Data
The "data" directory contains input data files that are used for analyses documented by the various Jupyter notebooks. Please refer to the README file in the data directory for a full description of all files there (and also files that were too large to be stored in GitHub).

## Required Software
### Command-line bioinformatics tools
* Alignment was done using MAFFT version .
* Distance calculations were done using Mothur version 
* Maximum Likelihood Tree was created using FastTree version

### Executing Jupyter Notebooks
The .ipynb files are Jupyter notebooks, which can be downloaded and executed if you have Python and Jupyter installed on your computer. There are also a few required Python libraries, and you can install these by running:
pip install requirements.txt
### Python libraries used
* Ete3 used to annotate and visualize trees produced by FastTree
* Pandas used to read in distance files and calculate species distance summaries
* Basemap and Folium used to create distribution maps
* Seaborn and Bokeh used to create species inter/intra-specific distance plots
