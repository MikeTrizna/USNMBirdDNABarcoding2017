# USNM Bird Barcodes

This repository contains data and code used for the publication "DNA Barcoding, Collection Management, and the Bird Collection in the Smithsonianâ€™s National Museum of Natural History" by Schindel et al.

## Data
The "data" directory contains input data files that are used for analyses documented by the various Jupyter notebooks. Please refer to the README file in the data directory for a full description of all files there (and also files that were too large to be stored in GitHub).

## Required Software
### Command-line bioinformatics tools
* Alignment was done using [MAFFT](http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) version 7.221.
* Distance calculations were done using [Mothur](https://www.mothur.org/) version 1.39.0.
* Maximum Likelihood Tree was created using [FastTree](http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/) version 2.1.8.

### Executing Jupyter Notebooks
The .ipynb files are Jupyter notebooks, which can be downloaded and executed if you have Python and Jupyter installed on your computer. There are also a few required Python libraries.

### Python libraries used
* [Ete3](http://etetoolkit.org/) was used to annotate and visualize trees produced by FastTree
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) was used to read in distance files and calculate species distance summaries
* [Basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/) and [Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) were used to create distribution maps
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org) were used to create species inter/intra-specific distance plots
